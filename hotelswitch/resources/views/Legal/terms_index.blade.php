        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

        <h2>AGREEMENT BETWEEN CUSTOMER AND COMPANYNAME, L.P.,</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the HotelSwitch.com website (the "Website"). This Website is provided solely to assist customers
            in gathering travel information, determining the availability of travel-related goods and services, making
            legitimate reservations or otherwise transacting business with travel suppliers, and for no other purposes.
            The terms "we", "us", "our" and "HotelSwitch.com" refer to COMPANYNAME, L.P., a Texas limited partnership
            with registered office at COMPANYADRESS that offer an online travel
            service through the HotelSwitch.com website. The term "you" refers to the customer visiting the Website
            and/or booking a reservation through us on this Website, or through our customer service agents.</p>
        <p>This Website is offered to you conditioned upon your acceptance without modification of all the terms,
            conditions, and notices set forth below (collectively, the "Agreement"). Please read the Agreement
            carefully, as it contains important information about limitations of liability and resolution of disputes
            through arbitration rather than in court. You should also read our Privacy Policy, which also governs your
            use of the Website. By accessing or using this Website, booking any reservations for travel products or
            services, or contacting our call center agents, you agree that the Agreement then in force shall apply. If
            you do not agree to this Agreement, please do not use or book any reservations through this Website or our
            call center agents.</p>

        <h2>USE OF THE WEBSITE</h2>
        <p>As a condition of your use of this Website, you warrant that</p>
        <ol>
            <li>you are at least 18 years of age,</li>
            <li>you possess the legal authority to create a binding legal obligation,</li>
            <li>you will use this Website in accordance with this Agreement,</li>
            <li>you will only use this Website to make legitimate reservations for you or for another person for whom
                you are legally authorized to act,</li>
            <li>all information supplied by you on this Website is true, accurate, current and complete, and</li>
            <li>if you have an HotelSwitch.com account, you will safeguard your account information and will supervise
                and be completely responsible for any use of your account by anyone other than you. We retain the right
                at our sole discretion to deny access to anyone to this Website and the services we offer, at any time
                and for any reason, including, but not limited to, for violation of this Agreement.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>DISPUTES AND ARBITRATION</h2>
        <p>HotelSwitch.com is committed to customer satisfaction, so if you have a problem or dispute, we will try to
            resolve your concerns. But if we are unsuccessful, you or we may pursue claims as explained in this section.
        </p>
        <p>To give us an opportunity to resolve informally any disputes between you and us arising out of or relating in
            any way to the Website, this Agreement, our Privacy Policy, any services or products provided, any dealings
            with our customer service agents, or any representations made by us (&ldquo;Claims&rdquo;), you agree to
            communicate your Claim to HotelSwitch.com by contacting HotelSwitch.com Customer Support at
            help@hotelswitch.com. You agree not to bring any suit or to initiate arbitration proceedings until 60 days
            after the date on which you communicated your Claim to Customer Support have elapsed. If we are not able to
            resolve your Claim within 60 days, you may seek relief through arbitration or in small claims court, as set
            forth below.</p>
        <p>You and HotelSwitch.com agree that any and all Claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in
            court, except that you and we may assert Claims on an individual basis in small claims court if they
            qualify. This includes any Claims you assert against us, our subsidiaries, travel suppliers or any companies
            offering products or services through us (which are beneficiaries of this arbitration agreement). This also
            includes any Claims that arose before you accepted this Agreement.</p>
        <p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an
            arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including statutory
            damages, attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs). The arbitrator must follow and enforce this Agreement.</p>
        <p>Arbitrations will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the
            AAA Consumer Rules. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's
            rules, except as provided in this section.</p>
        <p>Any and all proceedings to resolve Claims will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class,
            consolidated, or representative action. The arbitrator will have authority to decide issues as to the scope
            of this arbitration agreement and the arbitrability of Claims. If for any reason a Claim proceeds in court
            rather than in arbitration, you and we each waive any right to a jury trial.</p>
        <p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your Claims
            to &ldquo;COMPANYNAME Legal: Arbitration Claim Manager,&rdquo; at COMPANYNAME, COMPANYADDRESS. If we request
            arbitration against you, we will give you notice at the email address you have provided. The AAA's rules and
            filing instructions are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.</p>
        <p>This arbitration agreement shall be governed by and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act
            and federal arbitration law. An arbitration decision may be confirmed by any court with competent
            jurisdiction.</p>

            the service and/or activity they offer. You understand that any violation of any such supplier's conditions

        <h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
        <p>HotelSwitch.com believes in protecting your privacy. Please click here to review our current Privacy Policy,
            which also governs your use of HotelSwitch.com, to understand our practices: Privacy Policy
            (https://www.hotelswitch.com/privacy.html).</p>

        <h2>PREPAID PROPERTY RESERVATIONS</h2>
        <p>You acknowledge that HotelSwitch.com pre-negotiates certain room rates with property suppliers to facilitate
            the booking of reservations on your behalf. You also acknowledge that HotelSwitch.com provides you services
            to facilitate such booking of reservations for a consideration (the "facilitation fee"). The room rate
            displayed on the Website is a combination of the pre-negotiated room rate for rooms reserved on your behalf
            by HotelSwitch.com and the facilitation fee retained by HotelSwitch.com to compensate us for our services.
        </p>
        <p>You authorize HotelSwitch.com to book reservations for the displayed reservation price, which includes the
            room rate, our facilitation fee, and where applicable, taxes on HotelSwitch.com services.</p>
        <p>The displayed reservation price doesn&rsquo;t include, when applicable, tourist and/or local occupancy tax,
            specific resort/hotel fees or any other property/local fees or taxes that might exist. HotelSwitch.com will
            never charge you for such additional fees that when applicable need to be paid upon check-in. We will always
            try to give you an accurate estimate of such fees/taxes but we disclaim all liability for any errors or
            other inaccuracies relating to this information. Please confirm directly with the property if there is any
            additional fee/tax to be paid on arrival.</p>
        <p>You agree that your credit card will be charged for the displayed reservation price by COMPANYNAME which is
            doing business as HotelSwitch.com. Upon submitting your reservation request you authorize COMPANYNAME to
            facilitate property reservations on your behalf, including making payment arrangements with property
            suppliers.</p>
        <p>You acknowledge that, except as provided below with respect to tax obligations on the amounts we retain for
            our services, HotelSwitch.com does not collect taxes for remittance to applicable taxing authorities. The
            tax recovery charges on prepaid property transactions are a recovery of the estimated sales/value added
            taxes that HotelSwitch.com pays to the property supplier. The property suppliers invoice HotelSwitch.com for
            tax amounts. The property suppliers are responsible for remitting applicable taxes to the applicable taxing
            jurisdictions. HotelSwitch.com does not act as co-vendors with the supplier with whom we book or reserve our
            customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary greatly by location. The actual
            tax amounts paid by HotelSwitch.com to the property suppliers may vary from the tax recovery charge amounts,
            depending upon the rates, taxability, etc. in effect at the time of the actual use of the property by our
            customers. We retain our fees as compensation in servicing your travel reservation. Our fees vary based on
            the amount and type of property reservation.</p>
        <p>Sales/value added taxes are imposed on the amounts that we charge for our services (service fee and/or
            facilitation fee) in certain jurisdictions. The actual tax amounts on our services may vary depending on the
            rates in effect at the time of your property stay.</p>

        <h2>PAY NOW ONLINE OR PAY LATER AT PROPERTY DETAILS</h2>
        <p>With certain properties, you may be presented with the option to pay online immediately or to pay later at
            the property itself. If you select the option to pay online immediately, you will be charged the amount in
            the currency that you select immediately. If you select to pay later at the property itself, the property
            will charge you in the local currency of the relevant property at the time of your stay. Tax rates and
            foreign exchange rates could change in the time between booking and stay. You shall provide the details of
            your payment card and the supplier or HotelSwitch.com will often have to verify: (i) the validity of the
            payment card (through a charge of a nominal value that is either refunded within a few days or deducted from
            the final payment due to the supplier) and, (ii) the availability of funds on the payment card (to be
            confirmed by the bank issuing your credit card). HotelSwitch.com reserves the right to cancel your booking
            if full payment is not received in a timely fashion (please see Supplier Rules and Restrictions).</p>
        <p>Many bank and credit card companies charge their account holders a transaction fee when the card issuer and
            the merchant location (as defined by the card brand (e.g. Visa, MasterCard, American Express) are in
            different countries. The currency exchange rate, if applicable, and any transaction fee are determined
            solely by the bank or other agency processing the transaction. These fees may be applied by the card issuer
            as a charge to the cardholders account. This means the amount listed on your credit or debit card statement
            may be a different figure than the figure shown on the billing summary page for a reservation booked on this
            Website. If you have any questions about these fees or any exchange rate applied to your booking, please
            contact your bank.</p>

        <h2>PRICES</h2>
        <p>The price of the travel services will be as quoted on the website from time to time, except in cases of
            obvious error. Prices are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect bookings already
            accepted. Despite HotelSwitch.com&rsquo;s best efforts, some of the travel services listed on the website
            may be incorrectly priced. HOTELSWITCH.COM EXPRESSLY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CORRECT ANY PRICING ERRORS ON OUR
            WEBSITE AND/OR ON PENDING RESERVATIONS MADE UNDER AN INCORRECT PRICE. IN SUCH EVENT, IF AVAILABLE, WE WILL
            OFFER YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP YOUR PENDING RESERVATION AT THE CORRECT PRICE OR WE WILL CANCEL YOUR
            RESERVATION WITHOUT PENALTY. HotelSwitch.com is under no obligation to provide travel services to you at an
            incorrect (lower) price, even after you have been sent confirmation of your booking.</p>

        <h2>CHANGES OR CANCELLATIONS</h2>
        <p>You can request to change or cancel your reservation by emailing our customer services at help@hotelswitch.com.</p>
        <p>Lodging suppliers may impose change and/or cancellation fees. Charges vary by reservation, so please review
            your confirmation email for details.</p>
        <p>You agree to pay any supplier required cancellation or change fees that you incur. Some properties do
            not permit changes to or cancellations of reservations after they are made, as indicated in the rules and
            restrictions for the property reservation. You agree to abide by the terms and conditions imposed with
            respect to your prepaid property reservations.</p>
        <p>In the event that a property is unable to honor your booking, HotelSwitch.com will not be liable for any cost
            incurred due to relocation.</p>
        <p>If you do not show for the first night of your reservation but plan to check-in for subsequent nights in the
            reservation, you must confirm the reservation with HotelSwitch.com no later than the original date of
            check-in to prevent cancellation of the whole booking. If you do not confirm the booking changes with
            HotelSwitch.com the whole booking may be cancelled and refunds will only be due to you in line with the
            Rules and Restrictions of the particular property, as notified in the booking process.</p>
        <p>These terms and conditions may not be changed by any unauthorized person, including employees of
            HotelSwitch.com.</p>

        <h2>TRAVEL DESTINATIONS</h2>
        <p>Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel
            to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. HotelSwitch.com urges passengers to review
            travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by the United States Government and/or by
            your specific country prior to booking travel to international destinations. Information on conditions in
            various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations can
